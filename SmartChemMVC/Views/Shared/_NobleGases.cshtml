    <p>One or both of the elements you have chosen are noble gases meaning:</p>
    <p>The noble gases, which include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon,
        have a valence of zero. This is because these elements have a full outermost electron shell, which makes them very stable and unreactive with other elements.</p>
